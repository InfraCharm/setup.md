### Access Control and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Access Control** is a fundamental security concept that ensures only authorized users can access specific resources, systems, or data. By managing access, organizations can prevent unauthorized actions, such as data breaches, accidental deletions, or system compromises.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is a specific method of managing access by assigning permissions based on roles within an organization. Instead of giving permissions directly to users, roles are created (e.g., admin, user, guest), and users are assigned to these roles, simplifying permission management.

Be sure to configure your system in a manner that allows those with access only to resources or data they will need for work.  

Recommended System Permission Guidelines:
- System Operator: Full Access
- System Administrator: Full Access
- Senior Server Staff: MC Server Start/Stop Access
- Server Developer: MC Server Files & Start/Stop Access
