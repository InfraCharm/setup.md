### Malicious Actors

As with any public server, your IP is exposed in some way to the public.

Malicious Actors (Hackers) are constantly scanning networks around the world in the hopes to find a vulnerable system they can attack.

Vulnerabilities come in many different shapes and sizes and chances are you may have of heard or seen them in the past.

**Some Examples**
<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>CVE-2021-44228 - Log4Shell (Log4J)</li>
    <li>CVE-2021-38003 - Google Chrome Vulnerability</li>
    <li>CVE-2022-21658 - RCE in Minecraft: Java Edition</li>
    <li>CVE-2023-29347 - Steam Client Vulnerability</li>
</ul>

### Strong Passwords

Having a strong password and a secure password storage are both great ways to help safeguard your system(s). 

A strong password is the first line of defense against unauthorized access. A weak or commonly used password makes it easy for malicious actors to gain access to your account(s) or system(s).

**Strong Password Guidelines**
<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>12-16 Characters</li>
    <li>Includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (where applicable)</li>
    <li>Avoids common words, patterns, or easily guessable information</li>
</ul>

### Security Updates

Software and Security updates often include multiple patches that fix vulnerabilities found either publicly through BugBounties or from the developers. 

**Outdated software can leave you exposed to attacks**

Always update your software when a new release has been sent out. At a minimum, you should be updating your system(s) once a week if updates are available.
