Backups provide a peace of mind during events where your files become corrupt or if you are attacked by malware/ransomware.

Having a built incident response plan can make or break your ability to overcome issues in production.

### Incident Response

**What is *your* first step of recovering your system after a failure?**  
  
This question needs to be answered in detail in an incident response plan. Your plan should cover multiple different types of incidents like a security breach, file corruption, malware removal, and unauthorized access.

If you are unsure of what you would do in any of these scenarios, keep reading.

### What to Backup

When configuring backups for your system(s), you need to gather a list of which directories hold your most important data.

For businesses this would be client data, financials, and core services that your clients might use.

In the sense of game servers and game server hosting, you would want to save your databases that addons or plugins might use, as well as information about your panel and the actual game server files.

Having these backed up properly will expedite your ability to come back online when accidents happen.

### How to Take Backups

Follow the 3-2-1 rule for backing up your system(s). You should have:
<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>3 Total Backups</li>
    <li>2 Local Backup on seperate machines</li>
    <li>1 Offsite Backup through a storage provider</li>
</ul>

There are many storage providers out there and FOSS backup tools you can install and use. We won't get into that here but a quick google search should bring you to where you need to be.
